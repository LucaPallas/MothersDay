<h2>Kieran Goodwill ~ S3939981</h2>

<p>
G’day! I’m Kieran. I have had a brief foray into IT studies with a Diploma of IT that I completed in 2014. I’ve been interested in the IT field for decades, always dabbling in games or hardware but have now finally started a bachelor’s of IT. Outside of study, I like to play games (both video and board) with friends and rebuild furniture. I have a passion for food and the joy it can spread and host dinners regularly for friends. I am excited to have joined K.A.A.L.A.B to work towards completing our Mythos Project.

<p>
  I currently live in Far North Queensland with my wife and two young boys, having moved here from Northern Ireland in 2007.  I enjoy spending my free time in the outdoors, and have a particular interest in nature photography and mountain biking.  Although I have always had an interest in computers I do not have a professional background in I.T.  I have undertaken this course out of personal interest and to move into the IT profession in the future, possibly as a systems administrator or similar.  I am using my time in K.A.A.L.A.B. to further my skills and expand my knowledge as part of a team of like-minded people.

<! All three test results give a consistent summary of my strengths within a team.  I am hard-working, responsible and goal oriented.  I feel that this will be an asset to the team, as I can take ownership of tasks and be relied upon to do my best and follow through on what I have committed to.  I am confident in my abilities and willing to give things a go.  I learn best when I am doing something, so I can think on my feet and learn new skills as I work towards completing tasks.

<h2>Luca Pallas ~ S3940012</h2>
<img src="assets\images\luca.png">
<p>
    My name is Luca Pallas and I’m Australian with my Dad being English and my Mum Italian. Besides this course, I have studied one unit of coding (C++) at university previously and more recently completed a Certificate IV in Programming (C#, Java, SQL, .NET).<br><br>I’m interested in IT, particularly programming/software development as it appeals to the part of me that likes to problem solve, and the fact that programming involves having an issue or desired outcome that needs to be resolved/achieved, and then needing to find the best algorithm/method to do that really interests me. On a broader level this also applies to troubleshooting and testing/bug fixing, as even though it can be frustrating, the sense of accomplishment once you find the solution keeps me interested and wanting to learn more.<br><br> My pastimes are watching shows with my partner, fiddling around with my guitar and bass and playing videogames (Skyrim currently). I’ve also recently become a father to a beautiful baby boy, who is almost 3 months old, so have been enjoying watching him grow and learn new things. I'm enjoying being the 'L' in K.A.A.L.A.B and think we're going to do quite well together.

  <h2>Aidan Fox ~ S3956717</h2>
  <img id=img src="assets\images\aidan.jpg">
  <p>
    I'm a Rural boy who grew into computing to keep touch with the world, my Hobbies are exploring new genres of Music, Combat Flight Simulators, Virtual Reality and designing gaming PC’s for friends. I'm passionate about IT and want to learn everything I can so that I can keep what I've learned current. My experience with IT starts and stops at the consumer level however I’ve played at being a support technician long enough for the gap between the mask and me to become hard to see. I'm part of team K.A.A.L.A.B and I hope that I can use some of the skills I taught myself from some of my lesser defining hobbies to really prove myself.

<p>
  Born in Queensland and now residing in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. Worked as a Corporate Banking Professional for 5 years and am now pursuing to develop in IT to hopefully enter a career within the industry.<br><br>

  The change to a career in IT was founded from a childhood interest in computing, Basic HTML and Web-Design. Due to lack of professional skills, I am hoping to further skills as a member of the K.A.A.L.A.B Team and have it potentially lead to a career in Software Engineering & Development.

  <h1>Team Personality Breakdown</h1>
  <img src="assets\images\kaalab_test_comparison.png" class="personality_table">
  <br class=clear>
  <h2>Myers-Briggs</h2>
  <p>
    Our team consists of the following personality types:
    <ul>
      <li>A Logistician. These tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose. <br>Personality traits - Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging</li>
    <li>Two Advocates. These tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things. <br>Personality traits - Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging</li>
    <li>An Adventurer. These tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials. <br>Personality traits - Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting</li>
    <li>A Debater. These tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.<br>Personality traits - Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting</li>
    <li>A Protagonist. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals. <br>Personality traits - Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging</li>
    We also have a blend of 4 Turbulent and 2 Assertive identities, which tie in with the different personality types e.g. Assertive Advocate & Turbulent Debater (https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent)
    <br>Definitions from https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Learning Styles</h2>
  <p>
      For all team members the highest scoring learning style is Kinesthetic (learning by doing) followed by Visual (learning by watching) and finally Auditory (learning by listening). The exception being Kieran who had an equal score for both Kinesthetic and Visual.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Big 5 </h2>
  <p>
      TThe area that team members were most alike in was the score for Intellect/Imagination and Agreeableness, with Extroversion and Emotional Stability having the greatest variation.  
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Team Results Analysis </h2>
  <p>
      With the mix of different personality types the team has a good spread of different approaches to tackling the assignment at hand, which will allow for more than one method to solving problems. This is good as if there were 6 of the same personality in the group it could lead to a tunnel visioned approach.<br><br>
      However, the fact that team members all share the same learning styles and have high core in Agreeableness and Intellect/Imagination means that we will all be roughly on the same page in terms of understanding each other and being able to grasp each other's train of thought. <br><br>
      Overall, this mix of differing personalities with similar ways of learning and thinking, as well as all being willing and able to work well with others, should lead to a well-balanced and productive team.
